# Final-Project
This tutorial will show the reader how to work with data through the data science pipeline, from Data Collection, Data Curation, Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Machine Learning, and finally to Interpretation of the results. This tutorial will be using data collected about the ongoing Russian invasion and war in Ukraine.
Communication during warfare has always been of the utmost importance, especially in military intelligence and counterintelligence. As warfare has become more complex, so too has the information that must be passed around. Additionally, while propaganda is an important part of warfare, it is important to be aware of what's really happening on the ground, in order to make the optimal decisions.
With the increase in data complexity and massive influx of false or misleading data in the modern world, data processing, and statistical techniques have become vital to make sense of the incoming data in order to use resources more efficiently and prevent unnecessary losses, not only of equipment but also of life.
